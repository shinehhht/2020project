# ESTR2020: Bayesian Matrix Factorization

### MAP Estimation
We implemented traditional MAP-based Probabilistic Matrix 
Factorization (PMF) algorithm using gradient descent. 

The implementation can be found in *model.py*.

### MCMC Sampling
To further improve our model's performance, we present another 
optimized algorithm called BPMF to predict the rating scores. 


The code can be found in *bpmf.py*
